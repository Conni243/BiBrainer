# BiBrainer

BiBrainer is an external Editor of the Neural Network from a Bibite, a creature from the game:
"The Bibites: Digital Life"     https://www.youtube.com/c/thebibitesdigitallife  
Features:

  - The ability to add and remove hidden neurons (name, and function)
  - The ability to add and remove synapses (input, output, weight and if they are enabled)
  - My attempt at copying the ingame Nerual Network Display
